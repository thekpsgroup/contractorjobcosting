Areas for improvement

Visual balance: The heavy reliance on text can feel overwhelming. Introducing simple diagrams (e.g., a flow of “lead → job → invoice → payment”) or custom icons for each deliverable could help break up text blocks without making it look like a SaaS product.

Mobile responsiveness: While the layout likely uses responsive CSS, I wasn’t able to test on small screens. Verify that font sizes and spacing adapt gracefully on phones, especially the dense lists of outcomes and FAQs.

Form feedback: The contact form uses a server action; when submitting, ensure there are clear loading states and error messages. Currently the “Send Message” button simply transitions from “Sending…” to success; adding inline field validation would improve UX.

Additional visual cues: Lists of “Good Fit / Not a Fit” and deliverables could use icons or subtle backgrounds to differentiate positive vs. negative points. This would make scanning easier.

Legal/footer consistency: The affiliate disclosure on platform pages is clearly written; however, the QuickBooks page (not shown) previously contained ProAdvisor claims that should be reviewed for accuracy and compliance.

Interactivity/engagement: A short video or interactive demonstration (e.g., a sample job-costing dashboard) could give visitors a stronger sense of the service’s outcome.
