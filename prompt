# Marketing Website Project Overview

### You are Claude (best available model). Build a complete, production-ready marketing website codebase for a niche SMB service brand. You may choose whatever implementation approach you think is best for a small, fast, SEO-focused site (pick the stack, hosting target, and architecture). The only hard constraint: **do not make it look like SaaS** (no dashboard vibe, no app shell, no “product UI,” no login, no sidebar nav, no pricing-table-as-a-SaaS trope)

# Brand / Domain

- Brand: Contractor Job Costing
- Domain: contractorjobcosting.com
- Legal attribution: display clearly (footer and/or about): “Contractor Job Costing is a service of The KPS Group.”
- Positioning: Job costing + cash flow implementation for owner-led contractors. Productized, fixed-scope install + optional monthly management.
- Affiliate context: We are a PartnerStack partner for Jobber + Housecall Pro.
  - Wherever referral links appear, include this disclosure near the link:
    “Disclosure: We may earn a referral commission at no additional cost to you.”
  - Do NOT claim “official,” “certified,” or “authorized” partner status.

# Primary Goal

Generate booked calls / qualified leads for:
**“30-Day Contractor Job Costing Install”**

# Design Direction (IMPORTANT: not SaaS)

Make it feel like a serious contractor/business services brand:

- Text-forward, bold headings, clear sections, strong hierarchy
- Minimal, modern, “contractor serious” aesthetic
- Mostly black/white/gray with a single subtle accent color
- No stock photos (use simple shapes, lines, icons if needed)
- Avoid SaaS patterns: no dashboards, no product UI, no feature grids that feel like software, no “app” language
- Use accessible typography, focus states, keyboard navigation

1) Home: /
2) Offer page: /offer
3) Proof (outcomes/case studies): /proof

## The Offer Definition (must be consistent across site)

Service: **30-Day Contractor Job Costing Install**

Deliverables (fixed scope):

1) Profit-per-job scoreboard (Labor / Materials / Subs) + gross profit view
2) Job costing rules: what gets coded where + who enters what + weekly checks
3) Billing & AR cadence: invoice timing + collections routine
4) Weekly 45-min “profit meeting” cadence: agenda + action tracker + owners/dates

Requirements from client:

- Accounting access or exports
- List of jobs/invoices from last 60–90 days
- Owner + ops lead attend weekly call

Outcomes (state as typical, not guaranteed):

- margin clarity per job
- identify top 3–5 profit leaks
- faster invoicing/collections discipline
- weekly operating rhythm

Optional upsell (mention lightly, not pushy):

- “Managed Job Costing” monthly cadence to keep it alive.

## Ideal Customer

Owner-led contractors/trades doing roughly $750k–$8M/year who are busy but don’t trust margins/cash.

## Disqualifiers (state clearly)

- won’t share numbers
- won’t show up weekly
- want “free advice” without implementation

# Platform Pages Requirements

Each platform page must:

- Speak to buyers already using that platform
- Describe what we configure and what we do NOT do
- Include the disclosure near any referral link
- Avoid any implication of official certification/partnership
- Provide a clear CTA back to /offer and “Book a call”
- Referral links should be configurable in one place (so we can swap/disable easily).

# Output Requirements

1) Output the entire codebase in one response with clear file boundaries.
2) Include a README with:
   - how to run locally
   - how to configure booking link, email sending, analytics, verification meta tag
   - how to deploy to a typical hosting provider
   - how to test the form + event tracking
3) No “TODO add copy” anywhere. Write the copy now.
4) Ensure the project builds cleanly and is production-ready.

After the codebase, output a short “Launch Checklist” (10 bullets max) covering:

- domain/DNS basics
- analytics + search console
- configuring booking link + email delivery
- testing form end-to-end
- submitting sitemap
