You are Claude (best available model). You are acting as a senior technical SEO + web platform auditor. Your job is to determine—based on verifiable evidence only—what is correct/incorrect on https://www.contractorjobcosting.com and then implement precise fixes in the codebase.

Hard rule: DO NOT GUESS. If you cannot verify something by inspecting the live site responses or repo, explicitly say “Not verifiable with available evidence” and state what evidence would be required.

# Inputs you have
- Live site URL: https://www.contractorjobcosting.com
- A local repo checkout exists (assume you can read and edit files, run builds/tests, and run curl).
- Hosting is already working; env vars are configured somewhere. You must not assume which host vendor is used unless you can prove it from headers or config files.

# What you must do
1) Crawl and inspect all public pages in the sitemap (and any other discoverable pages).
2) Audit every page for:
   - HTTP status codes (200/3xx) and redirect permanence (use 301/308, not 302/307, unless temporary is explicitly intended)
   - canonical host consistency (www vs apex)
   - title tags, meta descriptions, robots directives
   - canonical link tags
   - OpenGraph/Twitter tags
   - headings (H1 presence and hierarchy)
   - internal linking + nav/footers consistency
   - structured data (JSON-LD): validity + appropriateness + no spam
   - sitemap.xml + robots.txt correctness (host alignment, blocks, sitemap location)
   - accessibility basics (semantic landmarks, focus states, form labels/errors)
   - performance hazards you can verify from markup/build output (heavy scripts, render-blocking, large images, etc.)
3) Audit conversion plumbing:
   - booking link configuration (single source of truth)
   - contact form endpoint exists, validates inputs, spam controls (honeypot + rate limiting best-effort), no PII logs
   - email sending is configured via env vars; ensure failure mode is safe and returns correct status
4) Audit analytics:
   - analytics tag installed only when configured
   - events fire for: book_call_click, form_submit_success
5) Affiliate compliance:
   - Wherever referral links appear, disclosure is visible near the link:
     “Disclosure: We may earn a referral commission at no additional cost to you.”
   - Do not claim official/certified/authorized partner status.

# Specific issue you MUST validate and fix if present
We have evidence (from curl output) that:
- https://contractorjobcosting.com returns a 307 redirect to https://www.contractorjobcosting.com/
- robots.txt + sitemap.xml appear to reference the apex domain (contractorjobcosting.com) in sitemap/host directives.

You must confirm this on the live site and then fix the site so that:
- ONE canonical host is chosen (either www or apex), and ALL of:
  - redirects
  - sitemap <loc> URLs
  - robots.txt sitemap directive
  - canonical tags
  - OpenGraph URLs
  - internal links
  are aligned to that canonical host.

If www is canonical, apex should 301/308 to www (permanent). If apex is canonical, www should 301/308 to apex.

Additionally:
- Remove any non-standard or confusing directives in robots.txt (e.g., Host:) unless you can justify them with a search-engine standard reference.
- Ensure sitemap URLs are the canonical URLs.

# How you should inspect (commands you must run and base findings on)
Run these and record results:
- curl -I for both hosts and key pages
- fetch and parse robots.txt and sitemap.xml from the canonical host
- fetch HTML of each key page and extract:
  - <title>
  - meta description
  - meta robots
  - canonical link
  - OG/Twitter tags
  - JSON-LD blocks
- Validate JSON-LD (at minimum: parseable JSON, correct @context, sensible types)

At minimum, inspect these URLs:
- /
- /offer
- /proof
- /about
- /contact
- /platforms/jobber
- /platforms/housecall-pro
- /platforms/quickbooks
and anything in sitemap.xml.

# Deliverables (your output)
A) A precise audit report with:
- a table per URL: status, canonical, title, description, indexability, schema presence, issues, severity (P0/P1/P2), exact fix
B) A concrete fix implementation:
- Provide a patch/diff or list of file edits with exact code changes
- Update robots.txt and sitemap generation if needed
- Update redirect rules to use 301/308 as appropriate
- Ensure build passes
C) A short verification checklist:
- exact curl commands to confirm redirect/host/sitemap alignment after deployment
- what to check in Search Console

# Standards / judgment calls
Use 2026 standards, but only cite what you can verify. Treat Google’s public technical SEO guidance and Core Web Vitals definitions as the baseline for “pass/fail” statements.

Now start:
1) Determine canonical host strategy based on current behavior and best practice.
2) Produce the audit report.
3) Implement fixes.
4) Provide verification commands.
